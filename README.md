## Installing the XIVLuna Plugin Pack

To begin using the XIVLuna Plugin Pack, simply follow these straightforward steps:

1. Open Dalamud and navigate to `/xlsettings`.
2. Proceed to the Experimental tab.
3. Copy and paste the following URL into the custom plugin repositories list:
   ```
 
   ```
4. Click on the "+" button to include the repository.
5. Click on the "Save and Close" button to retain your changes.

Once completed, the XIVLuna Plugin Pack will appear in the Available Plugins tab within the Dalamud Plugin Installer. From there, you can proceed to install Penumbra.

For optimal functionality and ease of updates, it's advisable to refrain from manual installations involving the downloading and unpacking of release zip files into your devPlugins folder. Such manual installations may not provide automatic updates and can lead to conflicts. Therefore, it's recommended to remove any manually installed copies of Penumbra before transitioning to the custom plugin repository method.

For a visual guide on installation, you may refer to the instructional guide provided by unaffiliated user Serenity at [reniguide.info](https://reniguide.info/).
